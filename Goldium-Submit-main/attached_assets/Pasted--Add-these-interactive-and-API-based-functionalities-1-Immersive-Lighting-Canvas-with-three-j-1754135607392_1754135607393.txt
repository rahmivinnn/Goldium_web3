🔧 Add these interactive and API-based functionalities:
1. 🎮 Immersive Lighting Canvas with three.js or babylon.js
Use three.js or babylon.js to render a 3D canvas for the room layout tool

Allow dynamic lighting previews with real-time shadows and reflections

Users can rotate the view in 3D (basic orbit controls)

Lights dropped on canvas should emit visible glow

Optional: add material toggle (warm/cool tone, brightness slider)

2. 🛒 Shopify Storefront API Integration
Connect to Shopify using Storefront API (dummy token OK)

Fetch product list dynamically: lighting fixtures, lamps, chandeliers, etc.

Each item must have:

Image

Title

Description

Price

Variant selector (size, material)

Allow “Add to Cart” directly from canvas

Cart persists in session and syncs with Shopify checkout

3. 🤖 ChatGPT API Integration (OpenAI)
Use ChatGPT API to create a smart product assistant

Trigger via floating chat icon

Let the assistant help users with:

Product recommendations based on room style

Lighting tips

Common user questions like “How to create cozy lighting?”

Tone should be helpful, friendly, and brand-matching

Use dummy API key for now (sk-demo-key) if needed

4. 🔐 Firebase or Supabase Authentication & Storage (Dummy Mode OK)
Setup dummy Firebase or Supabase backend for:

User login (email or Google)

Save/load room designs (as JSON/image URL)

Retrieve user history and favorites

Use Realtime Database or Supabase Tables for design records

Structure:

bash
Copy
Edit
users/
  userID/
    savedDesigns/
      designID: {
        imageURL,
        components,
        timestamp
      }
Login flow:

Simple modal login

If not logged in, show “Please log in to save your design”

Use dummy tokens and fake user IDs for testing

📦 BONUS: Modular Plugin Handling
Each plugin should be self-contained

Use lazy loading for three.js and Shopify API components

If any plugin fails, fallback gracefully with alert or simplified UI

🧪 Notes for Builder:
DO NOT use default AI-generated layouts or placeholders.

All interactive features must feel engineered with UX in mind.

Animations must be smooth, not janky or randomly injected.
