# Overview

This is a full-stack DeFi application built for Solana mainnet that enables users to swap, send, and stake SOL and GOLD (Goldium) tokens. The application provides a comprehensive DeFi experience with wallet integration supporting multiple Solana wallets (Phantom, Solflare, Backpack), token swapping capabilities, transfers, and a staking system with rewards.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Educational content: English language only, comprehensive blockchain and DeFi modules.
Performance requirements: Instant balance detection (5 seconds max), smooth animations without lag.
**STRICT REQUIREMENT**: Absolutely NO mock data - all transactions must be REAL blockchain operations using actual wallet balances.
**PRODUCTION GRADE**: All features must work with authentic wallet connections for client presentation.
**GOLD TOKEN POLICY**: GOLD balance and staked GOLD must reflect only real user transactions - no dummy or simulated data.
**XP SYSTEM REQUIREMENT**: XP must be earned through actual Learn module completion, 1000 XP exchanges for exactly 1 GOLD token with real blockchain minting.
**VISUAL CONSISTENCY**: All GOLD token displays use the new premium 3D golden logo for professional appearance including swap interface tokens.
